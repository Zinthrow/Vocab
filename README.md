# Vocab
One of the first programs I made at the end of summer 2017 before I started taking my classes. It was supposed to be a vocabulary building
program implementing a GUI. It somewhat works, but I didn't understand data structures and many other basic concepts at the time.
I'm putting it on here for now but it's going to undergo a lot of changes because it looks and works attrociously.
